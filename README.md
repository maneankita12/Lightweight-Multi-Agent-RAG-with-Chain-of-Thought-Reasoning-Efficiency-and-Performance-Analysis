# Lightweight Multi-Agent RAG with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

## 📋 Project Description

This project implements and evaluates a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and Multi-Agent (MA) architectures. We systematically compare three progressive architectures (Baseline RAG, CoT-RAG, and MA-RAG) across multiple large language models including Ollama llama3.2 (3B), Groq Llama models (70B), and the Gemini family (2.0-flash, 2.5-flash variants) on three benchmark datasets: HotpotQA, Natural Questions, and FEVER.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Progressive Architecture Comparison**: Baseline RAG → CoT-RAG → MA-RAG
- **Multi-Model Evaluation**: Tested across 3 different LLMs ranging multiple parameters
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Evaluated on multi-hop reasoning, factual QA, and fact verification tasks
- **Scalable Vector Database**: 795,768 Wikipedia documents with FAISS indexing
- **Efficient Multi-Agent System**: Achieves 40% latency reduction while maintaining 84-86% F1 scores
