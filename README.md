Lightweight Multi-Agent RAG with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
A comprehensive evaluation of lightweight Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MA-RAG) systems enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
Overview
This repository presents a systematic investigation of three progressive RAG architectures, comparing their efficiency and performance:

Baseline RAG: Standard retrieval-augmented generation implementation
CoT-RAG: RAG enhanced with Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities
MA-RAG: Multi-Agent RAG system with distributed reasoning
